# Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP )
- This principle states that the objects of a super class should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application's behaviour.
- In other words, if S it a subtype of T, then the objects of type T should be replaceable with the objects of type S, without altering correctness.
- **Eg** :- If square extends Rectangle, we should be able to use a square anywhere a Rectangle is expected.
